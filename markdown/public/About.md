# About Niec

---

Niec is a project inspired by the need to create a newsletter by the students and for the students in our college [NIE, Mysuru](http://www.nie.ac.in/) :sparkles:. The main inspiration comes from a need for the student community to know what's going on around college and a means to contribute their experiences, knowledege and skills with each other!

This is *not* a newspaper :newspaper: which reports the general happennings, it is more like an editorial. It is more focused on *you*, your feats, projects and ideas that *you* want to share with everyone in our college. Might be that you like *stargazing* :telescope:, you can write about what you like about your hobby, or even go into technical details about lenses, and of course the wide variety of stars that you spy on :star:!

Another example would be to share your experiences on an event that you participated in :basketball_player:. Go ahead, and write about the different people you met, how the competition was conducted and how it was to *win* or *lose* :smile:. You are free to write technical or non-technical articles. Technical articles can range from anything like *How to set up the Xen hypervisor* to *Detecting musical notes with a microphone and a microcontroller* :thinking:.

Every now and then, selected articles will be published in the **newsletter** issue and this issue will be distributed in a digital format all around college. Have a nice time, and I hope you enjoy reading and writing here!
