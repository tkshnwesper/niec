This page talks about the general working of the site.

## Site Mechanics

---

First, let me explain **Public** and **Private** profiles. As a general rule on this site, public means *visible to the public* and private is something that is *visible only to the members of this site and who are logged in*. So, public profiles are visible to **Google** and other search engines and whoever tries to access it directly via a link. Private profiles on the other hand cannot be accessed by Google or people who are not logged in, but can be viewed by members of the site.

Public and Private **articles** play along the same lines, just that instead of Profiles it is about Articles: public, visible to everybody; private, visible only to logged in members.

**Drafts** play an important role in saving an article on the server that is still _work in progress_. Drafts are saved as they are, without any changes made by the server to them while saving so you can save them without worrying about inconsistensies :yin_yang:.
