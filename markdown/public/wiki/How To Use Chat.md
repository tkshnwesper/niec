# A Brief Introduction to IRC

---

In case you have missed the [Chat](http://irc.cryf.in) button, it is on the navbar at the top. Those of you using mobile devices :iphone: will have to toggle the menu to see it. The chat is basically through [IRC (Internet Relay Chat)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) hosted by [Freenode](https://freenode.net/).

If you are new to IRC, that's totally fine! :grin:
You just have to know a few things to get you started. IRC is primarily a chat server, but occasionally it is used even for file transfers! Chat rooms in IRC are known as channels. Channels are depicted by a `#` followed by the channel name. For example, our channel is `#niec`. Anyone can create new channels any time they like. You can even register your channel and make it your own if you would like to have some extra privileges. In our case, #niec has already been registered by us! :relieved:

Once you reach the site, you might get a little intimidated by the huge number of text fields with various options that you are not sure what they do. But there's no need to worry :smile: just set a **Nickname**, press **Connect** and you are ready to roll! You will be directed to a page with a navigation bar on the left which will have `Freenode` and `#niec` as options. You can switch between channels from this menu. The `#niec` channel is where the conversations happen. The `Freenode` channel is more like a lobby where you get messages from the server.

Freenode is a collection of servers. They share the load of hosting IRC because the volume of people using it is very large! Several organizations, work groups and communities use IRC instead of hosting their own servers because... Well, it is way easier to do!
